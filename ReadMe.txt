Python Mini Practice Projects

This repository contains small Python programs created as part of my Computer Science coursework.

The purpose of this repository is to practice and demonstrate core programming fundamentals while learning Python.  
All projects are intentionally simple and focus on understanding logic rather than building full-scale applications.

Topics Covered
- Variables and data types
- User input and output
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for / while)
- Functions
- Basic problem-solving

Project Structure
Each folder groups related programs based on the concept being practiced, such as:
- Conditional logic
- Loops and list operations
- Basic functions
- Simple calculations

Each subfolder includes a short README explaining the programs and concepts used.

Notes
These projects are part of my learning process and are meant to show progress and understanding of Python fundamentals.
